    Music Reviews is a website that wishes to provide the best and most recent reviews that will keep you up to date with your favoutrite artists and allow you to branch out and discover amazing underated artists. We sift through more than 50 music review publications, online and offline. We reckon it's a fairly representative spread of sources from the UK, US, Canada, Australia, Ireland and Germany. They're different, but they're all intelligent, independent and sussed and we think it gives a good cross-section of critical opinion. Not everyone gives numerical ratings so we read the reviews carefully and then have heated debates about whether it's a 7/10 or a 7.5/10. Sad, but true. Albums need at least five reviews to chart. They drop out of the main Recent Releases chart after six weeks, but they're still there in the longer timescale versions.
