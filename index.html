    Speaking to TMZ, the star explained he "didn't finish" the album in time; and would to go to Africa to complete it.
    "I just need to go and grab the soil... and have the mic in the open, so you can hear nature while we're recording.
    "I felt this energy when I was in Chicago. I felt the roots. We have to go to what is known as Africa.West added that the album had been pushed back to Black Friday, 23 November, after a member of his management team suggested he needed more time.
    "I started incorporating sounds that you never heard before and pushing and having concepts that people don't talk about," West said of the work-in-progress.
    "We have concepts talking about body-shaming and women being looked down upon for how many people that they slept with. It's just a full Ye album.""</p>
